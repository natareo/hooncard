# hoonrunes

this directory contains files for learning Hoon runes and for creating related documents

these documents are derived from "hooncard.odt" and "hoon-runes.tsv" which are part of the github.com/natareo/hooncard repository

the focus of this iteration has been to shorten the descriptions and to alphabetize the rune names

included are: 

- a Libre-office multipage spreadsheet, "hoonrunes-short.ods" and three comma-separated values spreadsheets exported therefrom

- a Libre-office document "hoonrunes.odt" used to produce one PDF and two PNG files with alternate formatting
